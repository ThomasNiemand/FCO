## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There is one NOTE: 

checking for future file timestamps ... NOTE
  unable to verify current time
  
We checked our package and did not find any timestamps. Presumably, it comes from an imported function.

Resubmission

New version integrated a lot of new features. 
  
Response: Please consider that we skip 1.x for the reason that the new version number fits with the intend of the new functions (e.g., gen_fit2, flex_co2, plot_fit2) who incorporate correct and misspecified models (2) instead of correct models (1) only.

* This is a package update from FCO 0.8.1 to 2.0.0
